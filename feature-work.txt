- **Countdown To Raffle Close** :: Publish a countdown to the end of the raffle in chat. Default: `False`
- **Countdown From** :: Start the countdown here, and end at 0 (zero)* Default: `10`

1. The countdown will only send messages every-other second on "odd"
counts.  This is to work around the 2-second cooldown limitation that
the Chatbot has.  This will mean that other responses may be delayed
slightly (e.g. the close announcement, winners, currency check requests,
etc).
